This is a theoretical app that would help the NHS with bed BedBlocking-frontend

# why?

This is an app for proof of concept and what would an app that could help with bedblocking maybe function like?  

my mother who has worked for the NHS, has seen inside the difficulties.  

This app looks to create functionality based on my mums input;

- bed counter (to keep track of how many beds are free in a ward)
- Add patients to register
- discharge patient function (discharge patients)
- Allow a variety of details to be captured about a patients
